### Hi there!

I am a Ph.D. Student in Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA. Thanks for stopping by!

<!--
**coenwerem/coenwerem** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- I am broadly interested in topics at the intersection of robotics (particularly mobile robotics and robotic manipulation), control theory, and machine learning. 
- Currently, I am exploring tracking and formation control problems in swarm robotics.
- You can reach me at `clintonenwerem at gmail dot com`.
